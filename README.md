The IoTGoat Project is a deliberately insecure firmware based on OpenWrt. The projectâ€™s goal is to teach users about the most common vulnerabilities typically found in IoT devices. The vulnerabilities will be based on the IoT Top 10 as documented by OWASP: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project.
