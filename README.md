# IoTGoat
 IoT Goat will be a deliberately insecure firmware based on OpenWrt. The projectâ€™s goal is to teach users about the most common vulnerabilities typically found in IoT devices. The vulnerabilities will be based on the top 10 vulnerabilities as documented by OWASP: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project
